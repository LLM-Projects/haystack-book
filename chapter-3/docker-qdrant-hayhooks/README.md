> P.S.: Since I ran the this earlier too I have the documents in the Qdrant Document Store. In your case this will not be the same.

### Utilities
- üìö [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai)
- ü™ù [Hayhooks](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hayhooks)
- üê≥ [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- üö¶ [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech)
- üîë [OpenAI](https://openai.com)

### Prerequisites
- Ensure docker is [installed](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) locally in your system and the docker daemon in running.
- Then clone the repository using the command: ```git clone https://github.com/LLM-Projects/haystack-book.git```.
- Move to the appropriate directory: ```cd chapter-3/docker-qdrant-hayhooks/```
- Then run the docker container: ```docker-compose --env-file .env up -d```. If you need to see the logs then disable the detached mode by removing the `-d` flag.
- If the containers are running successfully verify whether hayhooks and qdrant instances are up and running: http://localhost:1416/ and http://localhost:6333/dashboard.
- Then get an OpenAI API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and store it in `.env` file in the current directory which will be used later.
- Please make sure to keep the server running and don't terminate the terminal as well as the container.

### Working (Using Python)
- After the hayhooks and qdrant instances are up and running then we need to push the data to the qdrant data store and query the documents to get response.
- First we fetch the data. It can be from the API as shown or from anywhere. But the final output must be a list of documents where each [`Document`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/data-classes#document)  the `content` and the `metadata` which is optional.
- Then we make create a indexing [pipeline](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/reference/pipeline-api) to [write](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentwriter) the documents into the [QdrantDocumentStore](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/qdrant-document-store).

- Also, ensure to set the OpenAI API key as a environment variable.
- Then we have the prompt template which will be used in the [PromptBuilder](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/promptbuilder) component inside of Query Pipeline.
- Then we build the query pipeline where we [embed](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformerstextembedder) the query, perform the [retrieval](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/qdrantembeddingretriever) to get the closest documents using cosine similarity, and [generate](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/openaigenerator) a response based on the prompt from the prompt template as mentioned above.

- Display the response to the user.

### Working (Using [Hayhooks](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hayhooks))
- This setup uses Hayhooks, an application server that exposes Haystack pipelines as HTTP Endpoints.
![hayhooks start server command with mount](https://gist.github.com/assets/81156510/6da7b48d-be71-46d6-adc2-32f55c20c021)
- We can add or delete the pipeline using `/deploy` or `/undeploy` endpoint on hayhooks endpoint at port `1416`.
- Alternatively, we can mount the directory that contains the pipelines in the `.yml` format. And we can use them as deployed pipelines with the endpoint as the file name.

### Accessibility
- Python (as mentioned in the section above)
- CURL commands
- REST API requests

#### CURL
- For indexing (command for generic case):
```bash
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:1416/qdrant_indexing" \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
  "converter": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "meta": {},
        "data": <add_your_content_here>
      }
    ],
    "meta": {}
  },
  "writer": {}
}'
```
- For querying:
```bash
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:1416/qdrant_query" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "embedder": {
    "text": <ask_your_query_here>
  },
  "retriever": {}
}
```

#### REST API requests (using Postman or any other tools)
Contains the equivalent REST commands for the [cURL](https://github.com/LLM-Projects/haystack-book/blob/main/chapter-3/docker-qdrant-hayhooks/README.md#curl) methods from hayhooks served at `PORT::1416`:
- Indexing (/qdrant_indexing)
- Querying (/qdrant_query)
of the Qdrant Hayhooks Docker deployment.  
After the [setup](https://github.com/LLM-Projects/haystack-book/blob/main/chapter-3/docker-qdrant-hayhooks/README.md#prerequisites) with relevant data we can run the REST commands to perform the specified actions.

{
  "limit": 10,
